# PowerTools

## Setup
PowerTools **requires** [ClothConfig](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config), and that's it! Just drop the jars
into your mods folder in your Fabric installation!


##FAQ

- Q: Will there be a Forge version?
    - A: No. (Probably)
- Q: Will PowerTools come to *any* other Minecraft platforms?
    - A: Short answer: Maybe. PowerTools was not built with other platforms in mind, and the existing codebase would
  have to be heavily refactored and abstracted. Don't count on it happening any time soon.
- Q: I found a bug, what should I do?
    - A: Please read [Submitting A Bug Report](https://github.com/orangemonkey68/PowerTools/blob/master/SubmittingABugReport.md), and follow the steps found there.
